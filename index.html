                <p>I live in San Antonio,with my husband and 2 girls. I am a Texan through and through but have not always in Texas. I am originally for Michigan and yes that makes me a Yankee as well. But I hide the Yank side well! </p>

                <p><strong>My passion:</strong> Cooking & Helping others learn - Everyone has to eat but not everyone knows how to cook. I love expressing myself though food but even more I love sharing my knowledge with others. There's that saying, "You give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, but teach that man to fish and he'll eat for a life time." I want to help others expand there skills and who knows I may learn a few more tricks along the way.</p>

                <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I homescool my kids! I love being apart of their learning process and watching their minds grow. I never thought I was smart or capable enough to teach them. But, it turns out I was wrong. All the things I was taught when I was younger are coming back, they were never forgotten.</p>
