                <p>I am a <strong>Responsive Designer & Developer</strong> who thrives on visual storytelling and the best user experience. When I'm not working, you can find me hanging with my family by the pool or at TopGolf, swinging for the fences.</p>

                <p>I live in San Antonio,with my husband and 2 girls. I am a Texan through and through but have not always in Texas. I am originally for Michigan and yes that makes me a Yankee as well. But I hide the Yank side well! </p>

                <p><strong>My passion:</strong> Cooking & Helping others learn - Everyone has to eat but not everyone knows how to cook. I love expressing myself though food but even more I love sharing my knowledge with others. There's that saying, "You give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, but teach that man to fish and he'll eat for a life time." I want to help others expand there skills and who knows I may learn a few more tricks along the way.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I homescool my kids! I love being apart of their learning process and watching their minds grow. I never thought I was smart or capable enough to teach them. But, it turns out I was wrong. All the things I was taught when I was younger are coming back, they were never forgotten.</p>
